IB_Trading_Manager
==================

This Application allows to monitor some Stocks according to predifined strategies and to submit trading orders to Interactive Brokers.

The Stocks to monitor and the orders to be submitted need to be in a csv file.

The Application will read the csv file at start and monitor the stocks in a regular base. 

In Order to calculate the strategies historical data are retrieved vom IB and stored in local files. Thus will allow to collect a long timeframe of historical datas then availlable from IB.


I plan to advance the application later on and I appreciate any help . .
